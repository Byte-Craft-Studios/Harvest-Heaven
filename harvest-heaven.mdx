## Overview

Harvest Heaven is an immersive 2D top-down pixel art simulation game that challenges players to build a thriving village from the ground up. Starting as a lone survivor in a vast meadow, players must gather resources, craft tools, and gradually transform their surroundings into a bustling community. With a focus on survival mechanics, resource management, and community building, Harvest Heaven offers a unique blend of farming simulation, village management, and strategic defense.

## Key Features

- **Survival and Resource Management**: Gather materials like wood, stone, and food to craft tools and structures essential for survival.
- **Village Construction and Expansion**: Build houses, workshops, and community spaces to attract and support new villagers.
- **Dynamic Day-Night Cycle**: Experience different gameplay opportunities and challenges as day turns to night.
- **Villager Management System**: Each villager has unique traits, skills, and needs that must be managed to maintain community happiness.
- **Strategic Defense**: Build defensive structures and train guards to protect your village from increasingly difficult enemy attacks.
- **Skill Progression**: Develop your character's abilities in farming, crafting, combat, and more through active use.
- **Seasonal Challenges**: Adapt to changing seasons that affect crop growth, resource availability, and village needs.

## Technologies Used

- **Game Engine**: Unity with Universal Render Pipeline
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Art Style**: 2D Pixel Art
- **Animation**: Custom frame-by-frame character and environmental animations
- **Input System**: Unity's new Input System for responsive controls
- **AI**: Custom behavior trees for villagers and enemies

## Challenges and Learnings

Developing Harvest Heaven presented several significant challenges. One of the most complex aspects was creating an AI system that could handle multiple villagers with different needs, jobs, and behaviors simultaneously while maintaining game performance. We implemented a job system that allows villagers to intelligently prioritize tasks based on their skills, the village's needs, and time of day.

Another major challenge was balancing the difficulty progression. We needed to ensure that monster attacks became gradually more challenging without overwhelming new players. This required extensive playtesting and fine-tuning of enemy spawn rates, strength scaling, and defense mechanics.

As the project lead, I gained valuable experience coordinating our small development team and managing the various components of game development—from asset creation to programming and game balancing. Working with pixel art taught us the importance of clear visual communication within strict resolution constraints, while the complex systems design helped us understand how interconnected mechanics can create emergent gameplay.

## Outcome

Harvest Heaven has evolved into a charming and engaging village simulator with depth that rewards strategic thinking and careful resource management. The game successfully blends peaceful farming and building mechanics with tense defense scenarios, creating a gameplay loop that keeps players invested in their village's growth and safety.

The project showcases how Unity can be leveraged to create rich 2D experiences with complex systems. Harvest Heaven demonstrates our team's ability to create cohesive gameplay that combines multiple genres—simulation, strategy, and light combat—into a harmonious whole.

Future development will focus on expanding content with new buildings, crops, and villager types, as well as implementing community-requested features to enhance the longevity and replayability of the game.
